ABOUT VLSI COURSE:- 
VLSI stands for Very-Large-scale integration(VLSI), Which creates an integrated circuit(IC) by cobining millions of MOS
(metel oxide silicon transistor) over a single chip. VLSI started in 1970. when MOS integrated circuit chips were broadly
adopted, enabling compound semicoductor and telecommunication technologies to be explained microprocessor and the memorychips
in the VLSI devices before the intro of VLSI technology most IC's had a limited set of roles they could perform.

. IC(integrated circuits) are used various types of electric devices our mobile phone consists of IC. IC a circuit where
all or some of circuit elements are inseparably linked and electrically interconnected so it's consider invisible for 
construction and commerce before VLSI, IC size used to be much larger than it is now because of VLSI, designers can now add 
million of transistor and other components of a tiny chip.
